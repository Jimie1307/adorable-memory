                    <td> As it's name, you are committed to add the file into the repo in local machine. Write <i>git commit -m "[your message]"</i>Message is compulsary.
                    Message can be anything but preferably explanation on the commit. Can add a second message.</td>
                    <td> To tell Git to track the file. Just write <i>git add [file-name] </i> </td>. Adding '.' tells Git to track ALL the files
                    in the folder/repo.</td>
                    <td> To check the state (or status hehe) of the repo we're using. See the files that are 
                        committed/tracked and not committed/tracked.
                    </td>
                    <td> To make the file live on a remote repository.To do this, one must have SSH keys to connect local machine to
                        Github account. 
                    <p>How to make SSH key:
                        <p> 1) Type in terminal: <i>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Github email"</i><br>
                            2) Then, set the filename that will save the key.<br>
                            3) Enter passphrase if you want. Can leave blank.<br>
                        <b>Result: Identification saved in the file. Public key saved in the file in .pub.
                            Key fingerprint is added. Key's randomart image is provided.<br>
                            Use private key to push files into Github.
                        </b>
                        <p>Arguments involved: origin  <br> type: <i>git push origin master</i><br>
                        If you type <i>git push -u origin master</i> then next time, no need to type <i>origin master</i>. Just <i>git push</i></p>
                        </p>
                    </p></td>

        <h1>Git Branching</h1>
            <p>1. All commits are under master branch. <br>
            2. A commit can have numbers of commit under it. It is called feature branch. <br>
            3. Each branch minds their own business. They dint know what other branches are doing.<br>
            <b>BENEFITS: functions as a 'sandbox area' for updating a feature that may have broken code. So that does not affect the 
            master branch.Can be connected to main branch if it is finished.</b> <br>
            4. Hot Fix Branch: A SOS branch for quick bug fix.
            </p>
            <h2>How to branch</h2>
            <p><br>
                <b>1. git branch</b>: check what branch are you on and how many there are<br>
                <b>2. git checkout -b [name-of-branch]</b>: to make a new branch. to switch branches, type the same thing but without '-b'.
                <b>3. git diff:</b> shows what changes and compares two versions of the code.</b><br>
                <b>4. git merge master: merge the other branche with main branch </b> <br>
